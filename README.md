# Powered Up BLE library for ESP32
A library to control LEGO Powered Up, BOOST, train, Duplo, and WeDo 2.0 hubs (plus the
Powered Up Remote Control) from an ESP32 over Bluetooth low energy.

## button_motor.ino — a physical remote using the ESP32's own button

The simplest possible example: hold the ESP32's built-in button (pin 0) and whichever
motor is plugged into the hub runs, with the hub's LED turning green while held and red
when released. A good starting point if you want to build your own physical remote for
a LEGO creation.

```cpp
#include <PoweredUp.h>

PoweredUp myHub(nullptr, DEVICE_TYPE_ANY_HUB);

void setup() {
  myHub.connect();
}

void loop() {
  myHub.handleConnection();
  bool pressed = !digitalRead(0); // built-in button is active-low
  myHub.writeIndexColor(pressed ? LEGO_COLOR_GREEN : LEGO_COLOR_RED);
  myHub.writeMotor(pressed * 100);
}
```

See [`examples/button_motor`](examples/button_motor) for the full sketch.

## sensor_motor.ino — a motor and LED driven by a distance sensor

A motor and a WeDo 2.0 detect (infrared distance) sensor plugged into the same hub, in
either port - the sensor's reading drives both the motor's speed and the hub's LED
colour, so moving your hand closer/further changes both at once. `onDistanceChanged()`
with no port given finds the sensor itself, wherever it's plugged in.

```cpp
#include <PoweredUp.h>

PoweredUp myHub(nullptr, DEVICE_TYPE_ANY_HUB);
int detectSensorValue = 0;

void setup() {
  myHub.connect();
  myHub.onDistanceChanged([](int8_t distance){ detectSensorValue = distance; });
}

void loop() {
  myHub.handleConnection();
  myHub.writeIndexColor(detectSensorValue);            // 0-10, matches the LEGO_COLOR_* index range directly
  myHub.writeMotor(100 - detectSensorValue * 10);       // scaled up to the full -100..100 motor range
}
```

See [`examples/sensor_motor`](examples/sensor_motor) for the full sketch.

## train_hub.ino — a standalone train hub demo, no remote needed

Drives whichever motor is plugged into a Powered Up train hub back and forth, lighting
the hub's LED green while going forward and red while going backward. If a tilt sensor
is plugged in too, its x/y angle is printed to Serial.

```cpp
#include <PoweredUp.h>

PoweredUp hub(nullptr, DEVICE_TYPE_POWERED_UP_HUB);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  hub.connect();
  hub.onTiltChanged([](int8_t x, int8_t y){
    Serial.printf("Tilt angle: x=%d y=%d\n", x, y);
  });
}

void loop() {
  hub.handleConnection();
  hub.writeRGB(0, 255, 0); hub.writeMotor(60);  delay(2000); // forward, green
  hub.writeRGB(255, 0, 0); hub.writeMotor(-60); delay(2000); // backward, red
}
```

## train_remote.ino — a Remote Control driving a train hub, with a speed gauge

A LEGO Powered Up Remote Control drives a real train hub: the remote's up/down buttons
step the speed by 10% and repeat while held (like a keyboard key), the stop button halts
immediately and takes priority over up/down, and the hub's own button cycles through the
built-in LEGO colours on both the hub's and remote's LEDs at once. A 5-pixel NeoPixel
strip mirrors the current speed and colour as a lit bar.

```cpp
#include <PoweredUp.h>

PoweredUp hub(nullptr, DEVICE_TYPE_ANY_HUB);
PoweredUp remote(nullptr, DEVICE_TYPE_POWERED_UP_REMOTE);
int trainSpeed = 0;

void setup() {
  hub.connect();
  remote.connect();

  RemoteButtonHandle& btn = remote.remoteButton('A');
  btn.up.onPressed([](){ trainSpeed += 10; hub.writeMotor(trainSpeed); }, 200); // repeats every 200ms while held
  btn.down.onPressed([](){ trainSpeed -= 10; hub.writeMotor(trainSpeed); }, 200);
  btn.stop.onPressed([](){ trainSpeed = 0; hub.writeMotor(0); });

  hub.onButtonPressed([](){ /* cycle colourIndex, write it to both hub and remote */ });
}

void loop() {
  hub.handleConnection();
  remote.handleConnection();
}
```

See [`examples/train_remote`](examples/train_remote) for the full sketch (colour gauge, direction light, and NeoPixel wiring notes included).

## wifi_control.ino — driving a motor from a web page instead of BLE input

No physical controls at all - the ESP32 joins your WiFi network and serves a tiny web
page with forward/stop/backward links, driving whichever motor is plugged into the hub
based on which link you click.

```cpp
#include <PoweredUp.h>
#include <WiFi.h>

PoweredUp hub(nullptr, DEVICE_TYPE_ANY_HUB);
WiFiServer server(80);

void setup() {
  WiFi.begin("yourNetworkName", "yourPassword");
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) delay(500);
  server.begin();
  hub.connect();
}

void loop() {
  hub.handleConnection();
  // serves a page with /F, /S, /B links -> hub.writeMotor(1, 100/0/-100)
}
```

See [`examples/wifi_control`](examples/wifi_control) for the full sketch.

## analog_throttle.ino — a breadboard knob driving a real LEGO train

A potentiometer wired to the ESP32 acts as a physical throttle for a real LEGO train:
turn it one way to speed up forward, the other way to reverse, center to stop. Pressing
the hub's own button cycles its LED colour. A phone running the official LEGO app, or a
JavaScript library on a laptop, can't do the knob part at all - they have no GPIO/ADC to
read a physical control from. An ESP32 does, and this library turns that knob into a
motor command in about 10 lines of code:

```cpp
#include <PoweredUp.h>

#define POT_PIN 8  // potentiometer wiper - outer legs to 3.3V and GND

// DEVICE_TYPE_ANY_HUB connects to any supported LEGO hub - WeDo 2.0, Powered Up, BOOST,
// train, Duplo - but never a Remote Control, so this can't accidentally connect to a
// nearby remote instead of an actual hub.
PoweredUp hub(nullptr, DEVICE_TYPE_ANY_HUB);
int colorIndex = 1;

void setup() {
  hub.connect();
  hub.onButtonPressed([](){
    colorIndex = (colorIndex % 9) + 1;
    hub.writeIndexColor(colorIndex); // pressing the hub's own button cycles its LED
  });
}

void loop() {
  hub.handleConnection();
  int raw = analogRead(POT_PIN);
  hub.writeMotor(map(raw, 0, 4095, -100, 100)); // knob position -> motor speed/direction
  delay(20);
}
```

## Version 3.0.0 - the `PoweredUp` class 🎉

This library was rewritten around a new `PoweredUp` class that replaces the old `Wedo`
class - **this is a breaking change**, not a drop-in upgrade. Make one `PoweredUp`
object per LEGO device you want to talk to (a hub, a Remote Control, ...) - you can have
more than one connected to the same ESP32 at the same time. The same methods
(`writeMotor()`, `writeIndexColor()`, `onDistanceChanged()`, ...) work the same way
whether you're talking to a WeDo 2.0 hub or a Powered Up / BOOST / train hub - the
library figures out which protocol it's using for you. It's still built on the modern
**NimBLE-Arduino** library for performance, stability, and low memory usage.

### Requirements

- **ESP32** board
- **NimBLE-Arduino** library (automatically installed via Arduino Library Manager or add to platformio.ini)

### Installation

#### Arduino IDE
1. Install NimBLE-Arduino from Library Manager (search for "NimBLE-Arduino" by h2zero)
2. Install this library from Library Manager or download from GitHub

#### PlatformIO
Add to your `platformio.ini`:
```ini
lib_deps = 
    h2zero/NimBLE-Arduino @ ^1.4.0
    lemio/esp32_ble_wedo @ ^3.0.0
```

## API Reference

### PoweredUp(const char\* name = nullptr, LegoDeviceType deviceType = DEVICE_TYPE_ANY)

Makes an object representing one LEGO device. Pass a `name` to match a specific
device's advertised name, a `deviceType` to match a specific kind of device (see below),
both, or neither to connect to the first supported LEGO device found.

```cpp
PoweredUp hub;                                             // any supported LEGO device
PoweredUp hub(nullptr, DEVICE_TYPE_ANY_HUB);                // any hub, but never a Remote Control
PoweredUp remote(nullptr, DEVICE_TYPE_POWERED_UP_REMOTE);   // specifically a Remote Control
PoweredUp hub("My Train", DEVICE_TYPE_POWERED_UP_HUB);      // by name and kind
```

`LegoDeviceType` values: `DEVICE_TYPE_ANY`, `DEVICE_TYPE_ANY_HUB`, `DEVICE_TYPE_WEDO_HUB`,
`DEVICE_TYPE_DUPLO_TRAIN`, `DEVICE_TYPE_BOOST_HUB`, `DEVICE_TYPE_POWERED_UP_HUB` (train
hub, city hub, etc.), `DEVICE_TYPE_POWERED_UP_REMOTE`.

### connect(uint32_t timeoutMs = 30000)

Starts looking for the device and blocks until it's connected (or `timeoutMs` has
passed). Safe to call on more than one `PoweredUp` object in a row in `setup()`.

### connected() / ready()

`connected()` is true once the BLE connection is up. `ready()` is true once the last
command you sent has finished.

### handleConnection()

Call this every `loop()` - keeps the connection alive and lets background work
(reconnecting, re-subscribing sensors, discovering what's plugged in) happen.

### Actuators

```cpp
void writeMotor(int speed);                 // drives whichever motor is plugged in
void writeMotor(int port, int speed);       // port: 'A'/'B' or 1/2, if you need to be specific
void writeIndexColor(uint8_t color);        // a built-in LEGO colour, 0-10 - see LEGO_COLOR_* below
void writeRGB(uint8_t red, uint8_t green, uint8_t blue); // mix your own colour, each channel 0-255
void writeSound(unsigned int frequency, unsigned int length); // WeDo hubs only - piezo speaker
void writeLight(int value);                 // a plugged-in simple LEGO Power Functions light, -100..100
```

`speed`/`value` ranges are all -100 to 100. `writeMotor(speed)`/`writeLight(value)` find
the right port themselves - you only need the port-specific overload if more than one
matching device is attached (e.g. two motors on one hub).

`writeIndexColor()`'s built-in colours:
<pre>
#define LEGO_COLOR_BLACK 0
#define LEGO_COLOR_PINK 1
#define LEGO_COLOR_PURPLE 2
#define LEGO_COLOR_BLUE 3
#define LEGO_COLOR_CYAN 4
#define LEGO_COLOR_LIGHTGREEN 5
#define LEGO_COLOR_GREEN 6
#define LEGO_COLOR_YELLOW 7
#define LEGO_COLOR_ORANGE 8
#define LEGO_COLOR_RED 9
#define LEGO_COLOR_WHITE 10
</pre>

### Buttons & sensors

Callbacks are lambdas, not raw byte arrays - `[](){ ... }` for a button,
`[](int8_t x, int8_t y){ ... }` for a tilt sensor, etc. Since they're `std::function`,
they can capture variables (`[&colorIndex](){ ... }`), unlike a plain C function pointer.

```cpp
void onButtonPressed(std::function<void()> callback);   // the hub's own physical button - no port, there's only one
void onButtonReleased(std::function<void()> callback);

void onDistanceChanged(std::function<void(int8_t distance)> callback);        // a distance/proximity sensor, auto-detected, 0-10
void onTiltChanged(std::function<void(int8_t x, int8_t y)> callback);         // tilt angle, x/y degrees, -45 to 45, auto-detected
```

Both work on WeDo 2.0 hubs and Powered Up / BOOST / train hubs, and find the right
device themselves. A WeDo 2.0 hub does report what's plugged into each port (via its
port-type characteristic, the same way it reports attach/detach events), but if you
call `onDistanceChanged()`/`onTiltChanged()` before that report has arrived - e.g.
right after `connect()` - there's nothing to match against yet, so it assumes port A
and corrects itself automatically once the real attach event comes in.

For explicit port targeting instead of auto-detection, or to ask what's actually plugged
into a port, use `port('A')` (or `1`, `2`, ...):

```cpp
hub.port('A').onDistanceChanged([](int8_t distance){ ... });
hub.port('A').onTiltChanged([](int8_t x, int8_t y){ ... });

if (hub.port('A') == IO_TYPE_MOTION_SENSOR) {
  Serial.println("There's a motion sensor on port A");
}
```

`port()`'s comparison checks the same attach-tracking the library already uses
internally, so it's most reliable once `handleConnection()` has run for a bit after
`connect()` - checked immediately in `setup()`, a device that's physically plugged in
may not have reported its attach event yet.

A Remote Control's three buttons (up/stop/down) are addressed the same way, one handle
per port covering all three:

```cpp
RemoteButtonHandle& btn = remote.remoteButton('A'); // or remote.remoteButton() to auto-detect
btn.up.onPressed([](){ ... });
btn.up.onReleased([](){ ... });
btn.down.onPressed([](){ ... }, 200); // optional repeatMs - keep firing every 200ms while held, like a keyboard key
btn.stop.onPressed([](){ ... });      // stop takes priority: while held, up/down presses are suppressed
```

Advanced: `monitorInput(int port, RawInputHandler callback, uint8_t mode)` listens to a
specific mode yourself, callback shaped `std::function<void(int8_t* value, int size)>` -
see the `*Mode` enums in `PoweredUp.h`, or the "Port mode information" table the library
prints to Serial whenever something attaches, for what modes a given device supports.
Most people should use the methods above instead.

```cpp
void stopMonitoring(int port);   // stop listening on one port (including port()/remoteButton() handles targeting it)
void stopMonitoring();           // stop all monitoring on this connection
```

**A lambda footgun to know about:** a callback that captures a local variable *by
reference* will read freed memory if that local goes out of scope before the callback
fires later - general to `std::function`/lambdas, not specific to this library. Capture
by value, or use globals/member variables for anything a callback needs to persist.

### Advanced / escape hatches

```cpp
void writeCommand(uint8_t* command, int size, int type = WEDO_OUTPUT); // send a raw command yourself
void writePortDefinition(uint8_t port, uint8_t type, uint8_t mode, uint8_t format); // WeDo 2.0 only
void addNotificationHandler(std::function<void(uint8_t*, int)> f); // replaces the library's own notification handling with your own
```

Most sketches won't need these - `writeCommand()`'s `type` defaults to `WEDO_OUTPUT`
(motor/LED/sound commands); `WEDO_INPUT` is for the handful of WeDo-specific commands
that need it.
